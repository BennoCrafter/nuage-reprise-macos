The following year, with Spacedrome, he took part in the Croatian \"Outlook festival\". He also performs in many clubs in the capital and in other Italian cities as well as some adventure in Europe.\n\nAfter moving to Berlin the collective has been able to perform in different contexts, from Berlin clubs (Hoppettosse, Acud macht neu, Mensch meyer,About Blank,Void etc.) to festivals (Freqs\nof nature,Pik nick electronik etc.).\n\nBut you know, artistic paths can lead to changes in perspective and the Spacedrome project is temporarily put aside.\nFrom this break was born Save Your Atoll.","downloadable":false,"download_count":0,"duration":3674044,"full_duration":3674044,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Deep Techno","has_downloads_left":false,"id":1520947195,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2023-05-23T23:18:15Z","license":"all-rights-reserved","likes_count":124,"permalink":"274-save-your-atoll-ita","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/wildwoodpodcastseries/274-save-your-atoll-ita","playback_count":1522,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":1520947195,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1520947195","contains_music":true},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":38,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"\"Save Your Atoll\" Techno \"Deep Techno\"","title":"#274 - Save Your Atoll - (ITA)","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1520947195","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1520947195","user_id":218417802,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/Cktvvod366x5_m.json","display_date":"2023-05-23T23:15:23Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-v2.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1520947195/990b7198-6a3b-450a-a123-e25c1f97192e/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_1_0","duration":3674044,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-v2.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1520947195/990b7198-6a3b-450a-a123-e25c1f97192e/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_1_0","duration":3674044,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-v2.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1520947195/b7e866c7-523a-4570-b16f-4bdd927ea15b/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":3674012,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg; codecs=\"opus\""},"quality":"sq"}]},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:track-stations:1520947195","station_permalink":"track-stations:1520947195","track_authorization":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJnZW8iOiJDSCIsInN1YiI6IjEzOTAwNDA5OCIsInJpZCI6IiIsImlhdCI6MTY4ODI4ODgyN30.YMAZ7L5sed2fQEiHFm-taiJ98S0g2el52WhlTMRT7uI","monetization_model":"NOT_APPLICABLE","policy":"ALLOW","user":{"avatar_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-qXMewU1LMAFjBfZs-MC090Q-large.jpg","first_name":"Deep house - Progressive House -","followers_count":17877,"full_name":"Deep house - Progressive House - Techno","id":218417802,"kind":"user","last_modified":"2023-06-22T00:46:54Z","last_name":"Techno","permalink":"wildwoodpodcastseries","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/wildwoodpodcastseries","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/users/218417802","urn":"soundcloud:users:218417802","username":"Wildwood Podcast Series","verified":true,"city":"Melbourne","country_code":"AU","badges":{"pro":false,"pro_unlimited":true,"verified":true},"station_urn":"soundcloud:system-playlists:artist-stations:218417802","station_permalink":"artist-stations:218417802"}}},{"created_at":"2023-05-17T12:38:56Z","kind":"like","track":{"artwork_url":"https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-HLFMbDNQGbFwKz0I-cq67tg-large.jpg","caption":null,"commentable":true,"comment_count":31,"created_at":"2023-05-16T15:50:36Z","description":"Art Bei Ton Podcast 081: Feral\n( @feral_music )\n\nFor the 5th birthday of Art Bei Ton we're happy to celebrate with a special podcast from a special artist and friend, the Italian DJ and Producer Feral.\n\nMostly known for his rich and hypnotic live sets, he recorded for us a very deep and subtle DJ mix, showing a vast musical knowledge and an extreme quality in the mixing. With many percussive elements, and a vast array of soundscapes, this mix stands out for its clean sound and complex grooves organized in a smooth arrangement. \n\nEnjoy!\n\nMore info about Feral:\n\nMarked by his awakened sensibility to depth, Feral consistently carries a thread of spirituality throughout his work.  He has inherently embodied the spirit of deep techno, of which defines Hypnus Records, through his passion for audio engineering, hardware experimentation and fascination for percussive instruments.\n\nFeral’s affinity for the shamanic calls of the tribal drum have led him across the world to discover and nurture his defining sound. Finding comfort in the solitude of his studio, Feral’s visions emerge in the crepuscular hours of his native city, Rome.

One of its most talented heralds and a surefire groove rider at that, Yanamaste graces us with a choice two hours of the entrancingly deep and bumpy 4x4 epics he’s been laying down for INNSIGNN, Lyree and Khidi in recent times. Paced-up and animal to the core, his vision sweeps an extra wide range of shades and reliefs, nimbly moving the cursor from classic Berlin-inspired blends to full-fledged magmatic trance, via Birmingham-style projections and a solid dose of folk-infused harmonics. Raw yet technical, organic with a hint of hypermodern hoodoo to it, Yanamaste’s sound is the definition of hardware techno with soul, cut to ram-raid and elevate in equal measure. \n\nSoundcloud: bit.ly/yanamaste_sc\nFacebook: bit.ly/yanamaste_fb\nInstagram: bit.ly/yanamaste_ig\nBeatport: bit.ly/yanamaste_bp\nResident Advisor: bit.ly/yanamaste_ra\nBooking: kuba@khidi.ge","downloadable":false,"download_count":null,"duration":7253368,"full_duration":7253368,"embeddable_by":"all","genre":"Techno","has_downloads_left":false,"id":1462428118,"kind":"track","label_name":null,"last_modified":"2023-03-06T11:35:21Z","license":"all-rights-reserved","likes_count":null,"permalink":"reclaim-your-city-529-yanamaste","permalink_url":"https://soundcloud.com/reclaim-your-city/reclaim-your-city-529-yanamaste","playback_count":null,"public":true,"publisher_metadata":{"id":1462428118,"urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1462428118","artist":"Yanamaste","album_title":"Reclaim Your City  ","contains_music":true},"purchase_title":null,"purchase_url":null,"release_date":null,"reposts_count":0,"secret_token":null,"sharing":"public","state":"finished","streamable":true,"tag_list":"Yanamaste Khidi \"Reclaim Your City\" Rotterdam Berlin Tbilisi Techno Radio RYC Podcast","title":"Reclaim Your City 529 | Yanamaste","track_format":"single-track","uri":"https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/1462428118","urn":"soundcloud:tracks:1462428118","user_id":31525558,"visuals":null,"waveform_url":"https://wave.sndcdn.com/zItiKHxtoXod_m.json","display_date":"2023-03-06T11:35:20Z","media":{"transcodings":[{"url":"https://api-v2.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1462428118/024bb6d5-36a6-4b4c-8bd6-2e631efd6148/stream/hls","preset":"mp3_1_0","duration":7253368,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-v2.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1462428118/024bb6d5-36a6-4b4c-8bd6-2e631efd6148/stream/progressive","preset":"mp3_1_0","duration":7253368,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"progressive","mime_type":"audio/mpeg"},"quality":"sq"},{"url":"https://api-v2.soundcloud.com/media/soundcloud:tracks:1462428118/20ec2046-0c63-463e-a12e-c1f54be3ecb5/stream/hls","preset":"opus_0_0","duration":7253349,"snipped":false,"format":{"protocol":"hls","mime_type":"audio/ogg;
