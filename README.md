## About
Nuage is an independent and open-source project to build a native SoundCloud client for macOS using SwiftUI. Its overall goal is to make listening to tracks on SoundCloud more enjoyable by providing a light-weight and beautiful interface. As of now, the app is still very much in development, lots of features are still missing and the UI needs a lot of work too. So if you want to learn a little bit of SwiftUI or if you have a suggestion regarding the user experience, feel free to open an issue or a merge request.

Note that Nuage is not affiliated in any way to SoundCloud. Nuage uses private APIs which I have not been granted access to, so functionality may break in the future.

## Installation

Download the latest version right [here](https://github.com/lbrndnr/nuage-macos/releases). Note that Nuage is still in heavy development and on top of that written in SwiftUI, a very young framework. If you encounter a bug or miss a feature, don't hesitate to open a pull request.

## Dependencies

Nuage uses [StackNavigationView](https://github.com/lbrndnr/StackNavigationView) to push views onto the view hierarchy (which is not currently possible with SwiftUI 2) and [SoundCloud](https://github.com/lbrndnr/soundcloud) to access SoundCloud's private API.
